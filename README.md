# split_landing

## Description

A landing page with 2 btns and an image on the right and a description on the left. When the up btn is pushed the current image moves up to reveal a new image and the current description moves down to reveal the description for the new image. The down btn does the same as the up btn but moves everything in the opposite direction. This example has been optimised with a desktop view and is not currently set up for smaller screen sizes.

## Demo
